Musicality and sound is going to be a huge part of this game.

At the surface level I would like the world to change it's behaviour on a cadence of some amount of time. (A time scale to be determined that makes the most sense for both respecting the player's time and granting the most fun and immersion.)

An example would be:

- A 3 state cycle, using genres to differentiate. Ex. Swing, Techno, Country.
	- Each style would modify the world, nature would be responsible for changing it's behaviour and behaviour of obstacles would change so the player learns to expect particular behaviours depending on the style of music.
- A 3 speed cycle, using tempo to increase difficulty. Ex. slow, medium, fast.
	- This could allow different encounters to have more or less difficulty just based on how quickly the player is required to respond and how long the player has to detect what exactly the NPCs or other players are going to do.
