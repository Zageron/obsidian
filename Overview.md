# questions and answers
- How do I want players to interact with the environment? (NPCs, interactables, collisions)
  - with NPCs, prefer if players interact organically in read time. No entering a "state of interaction" with an action button. The player and NPC might enter such a state, but it would occur subtly and might not occur with consistency depending on what the NPC is doing at the time.
- Can the game be implemented and created as a single player game with zero networking and still remain true to your design?
  - I don't think so. I believe the MMO aspects can be removed, but I believe that the combat would be far more challenging and enjoyable with multiple people, learning and growing as they progress.
  - MMO aspects would make matchmaking much easier and allow for people of similar skill levels group up without having to rely on external systems to locate fellow players.
- why is there a find the fun in the list?
  - we don't want to waste time building pieces of the game if the core concepts aren't any fun.
